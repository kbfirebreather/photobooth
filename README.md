photobooth
==========

This is a Raspberry Pi python solution for a DIY photobooth. 

I am creating this using the Raspberry Pi Camera board for my wedding. Instead of spending $1000 renting a photobooth from a company, I am looking to save some money.

***Raspberry Pi Confiruation readme goes here***


***Python File Dependencies***

Create file "gmail.txt" 
	Line 1: gmail username
	Line 2: gmail password

This will be used to send "emails" for ink level notification

Create file "inklevel_receivers.txt"
	Put in an email address/text message addresses, one on each line for every address to be notified

More info needs to be added to this readme for raspberry pi setup
